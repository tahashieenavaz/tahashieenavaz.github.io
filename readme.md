# A Life Long Passion!
At the end of this year (I mean 2021) my Web Development career turns 9 and to my wonder I didn't have my personal URL yet.
This article describes the very basic features of this tiny little Javascript Applicaiton with great depth.

## Crazy Name
I needed a page loader.
I could use traditional "absolute" "top zero" bar but I decided to use my name instead.
And Why not ?

## Two Modes
Currently almost all modern websites encompass two modes DARK and LIGHT.
Mine includes those too.
In addition to loader status my name serves as mode toggle button.
Just click on it, and there you go!
